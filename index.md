<div style="text-align: justify">Used sentiment analysis to understand how people feel about hotels and restaurants based on their TripAdvisor reviews.</div>
<br>

- Tool Used: Python

- Method: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) lexicon

- What I Did:
  - Collected reviews from TripAdvisor
  - Used Python to analyze the reviews
  - Found out if reviews were positive, negative, neutral with compound score.

- What I Learned:
  - How to use Python for text analysis
  - How to understand customer feelings from their words
  - The importance of customer feedback for businesses

- Next Steps:
  - Use this method on other review sites
  - Compare results with other sentiment analysis tools
  - Share findings with business owners to help them improve

- Used the K-Nearest Neighbor model to analyze why employees might leave their jobs, helping companies keep their best workers.

- The K-Nearest Neighbor model did a great job. It was right about 96.33% of the time when predicting outcomes. This means it made correct guesses for almost 96 out of every 100 cases. This high accuracy shows that the model is very good at understanding and predicting patterns in the data. It's a strong result that suggests the K-Nearest Neighbor method works well for this particular problem.

## Linear Regression Analysis: Sales vs. Social Media Advertising Spend

[![Run in Google Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Colab-Run_in_Google_Colab-blue?logo=Google&logoColor=FDBA18)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BiuaPzMXjgbqZXN9IYlo-fFbGKay_da9#scrollTo=WGlR-FqI3HDu)

### Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of linear regression to analyze the relationship between sales and social media advertising spend.

### Data Visualization

### Methodology

We employed Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to fit a linear model to our dataset of 200 advertising sales. The model was implemented using Python's scikit-learn library.

### Key Findings

- The model explains 61% of the variance in sales (R² = 0.61)
- For every RM 50,000 increase in advertising budget:
  - Expected increase in units sold: 9,409
  - Projected revenue increase: RM 47,047,127.75

### Conclusion

Our analysis reveals a significant relationship between social media advertising spend and sales. This model can serve as a useful tool for estimating the impact of advertising budgets on sales performance, though other factors should also be considered for more accurate predictions with higher R² value.

### Future Work

- Incorporate additional features such as seasonality, and competitor advertising spend
- Develop a dashboard for real-time sales predictions based on advertising budget input
